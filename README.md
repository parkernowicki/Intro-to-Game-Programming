"# Intro-to-Game-Programming"

Various games I have made using SDL and OpenGL libraries, written in C++. The .exe is included for each game along with the source code, so look for that and run it if you want to play. Have fun!

I do not claim ownership of original materials used in these games, such as music and other assets.
